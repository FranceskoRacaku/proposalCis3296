# UML2.5 version java / Description


For this project I have an idea to create a program which can create uml diagrams based on the code. As we develope the code the uml diagrams should start creating. On other words should be able to generate the diagrams in all possible codes (php, java, C etc). Extra option is to be translated in different languages.

Having an UML Diagram ready while you build the program up, is always helpful and makes programming easier and more understandable. Having a program that creates the diagram is really something that everyone will love having.

The idea of doing this project start with focusing first on generating class diagrams with coding in Java. Then it continues in object diagram, composition structure diagram, then with adding attributes etc, more to find in here https://github.com/Harry055/UML2.5.
