# UML2.5 version java / Description


For this project I found an open source program which can create uml diagrams . This program should be able to generate the diagrams in all possible codes (php, java, C etc).

Having an UML Diagram ready while you build the program up, is always helpful and makes programming easier and more understandable.

The idea of doing this project start with focusing first on generating class diagrams with coding in Java. Then it continues in object diagram, composition structure diagram etc, more to find in here https://github.com/Harry055/UML2.5.

# Revelant Technology

- JAVA 
- JAVAFX
- FXML
- git repo
- Gradle
- Scene Builder

# Educational Goals

This project will mainyly focus on the following goals:

* Getting familiar with creating Class Diagrams

* Project Management



# Proposed Contribution

Looking at github of the author, the code is not fully developed so the good idea is to connect with him and see if he has any updated code or work. As soon as I saw that it caught my eyes, even tho there are plenty websites which create UML Diagrams, but having that done in java is a good idea. Since this is created in German Language my contribution in this will be to help with adding extra languages so everyone could be able to use it.
