# UML2.5 version java / Description


For this project I have an idea to create a program which can create uml diagrams based on the code. As we develope the code the uml diagrams should start creating. On other words should be able to generate the diagrams in all possible codes (php, java, C etc).

Having an UML Diagram ready while you build the program up, is always helpful and makes programming easier and more understandable. Having a program that creates the diagram is really something that everyone will love having.

The idea of doing this project start with focusing first on generating class diagrams with coding in Java. Then it continues in object diagram, composition structure diagram etc, more to find in here https://github.com/Harry055/UML2.5.

# Revelant Technology

- JAVA 
- JAVAFX
- FXML
- git repo
- Gradle
- Scene Builder

# Educational Goals

This project will mainyly focus on the following goals:

* Getting familiar with creating Class Diagrams

* Project Management

* 


# Proposed Contribution

Looking at github of the author, the code is not fully developed so the good idea is to connect with him and see if he has any updated code or work. As soon as I saw this idea I literally liked it a lot because it will be very helpful having an UML Diagram ready parallel in working with a certain program. Since this is created in German Language my contribution in this will be to help with adding extra languages so everyone could be able to use it.
