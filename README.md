# UML2.5 version java / Description


For this project I have an idea to create a program which can create uml diagrams based on the code. As we develope the code the uml diagrams should start creating. On other words should be able to generate the diagrams in all possible codes (php, java, C etc). Extra option is to be translated in different languages.
