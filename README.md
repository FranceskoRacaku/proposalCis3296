# Shortest Path Project

For this project I would like to create a program which will ask the user to enter two states in USA and it will find the shortest path to get there.

I am thinking to do that by creating a graph of cities in the United States with links to the other cities. Each city will be a vertex in the graph and each link between cities will be an edge in the graph. The cities will be read into array from a CSV data files.

The output of this project should be something like:
It will ask the user to put the name of a city, which will be the starting point, and then it will ask the name of second city which will be the destination.

This project will be a good choice in getting familiar how the google map, maps or other programs make it possible to find the fastest way to get to the required destination. Also more practice using JAVA, since I like programming in java.
